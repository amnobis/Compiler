# Compiler
My compiler for ECE468 at Purdue. Sometime after step 4, my code devolved into a big, steaming plate of spaghetti.
I continued using poor coding conventions by doing everything as iteratively as possible and poor style conventions such as mixing camel case and underscores.
May god have mercy on anyone stupid enough to try to plagerize from this repository.
